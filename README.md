# Customer-Churn-Risk-Prediction

Customer churn is a significant challenge for businesses, as retaining customers is often more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. Accurately predicting churn risk allows organizations to implement targeted strategies to improve customer retention. This study focuses on developing a machine learning model to predict churn risk scores, which range from 1 to 5, based on a dataset encompassing demographic details, membership information, browsing behaviour, purchase history, loyalty transactions, and customer service interactions.

The dataset underwent extensive data cleaning and preprocessing, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and extracting relevant temporal features. Specific attributes, such as exact timestamps, were removed to enhance model efficiency and interpretability. Feature engineering was performed to modify relevant features to gain insights, ensuring optimal model performance.For predictive modeling, we employed Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression, XGBoost, and Random Forest, evaluating their performance based on classification metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

This research highlights the effectiveness of machine learning in churn prediction and underscores the importance of data-driven strategies in modern customer relationship management.
